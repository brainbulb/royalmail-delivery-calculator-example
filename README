## OVERVIEW ##

Example project which provides an estimated delivery date, using a delivery supplier agnostic algorithm.

1.) Web service which outputs an estimated delivery date using a supplier agnostic algorithm.
2.) Web form, using the web service to display an estimated delivery date in a human readable format, given a supplier name, date, time and country.
3.) Database structure for an e-commerce system which has one or more delivery suppliers, products, customers, orders etc.


## QUESTIONS ##

1.) What format should the web service output the estimated delivery date in?
2.) Step 1 doesn't make sense about the public repo. It conflicts with other info. Do we really want everything to be public?

## APPROACH ##

Usually I would ask questions to clarify matters before starting work.
I'm going on the basis of using symfony components to produce a lightning fast web service.
